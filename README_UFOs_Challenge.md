# UFOs Challenge

## OVERVIEW

### Dana is a Datajounalist.  She is from a town that has a history with UFO sigtings and has a big interest in the subject.  She has a javascript datafile on UFO sightings including details like: dates, cities, states, countries, types of sigtings and descriptions.

### The plan for Dana is to build a website that will allow users to filter the data as they like (e.g. by date, city, state, type etc.).  This project is going to use JavaScript which is a front end development language.  It adds functions and customizations to enhance the user experience.  The focus of this project will be to develop dynamic webpages.  These will be built by inserting JavaScript into an HTML page.  WE will also incorporate our knowledge of CSS, bootstrap and Chrome Development tools.

### The first step in this project will be to build a table and then add filters to the table that will allow users to refine their search on more thab one level.  This webpage will also include an attention grabbing header, an article summary and a brief article description with the goal of presenting an interactive webpage that is also visually appealing.
